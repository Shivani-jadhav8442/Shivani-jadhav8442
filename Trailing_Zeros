Initial Setup
n = 6
low = 0, high = 30 (since 5 * 6 = 30)
Iteration Details
First Iteration:

Calculate mid: (0 + 30) / 2 = 15
Check 15!:
15 / 5 = 3 (3 factors of 5)
15 / 25 = 0 (0 additional factors of 25)
Total trailing zeros = 3
Result: 3 < 6, so set low = 16
Second Iteration:

Calculate mid: (16 + 30) / 2 = 23
Check 23!:
23 / 5 = 4 (4 factors of 5)
23 / 25 = 0 (0 additional factors of 25)
Total trailing zeros = 4
Result: 4 < 6, so set low = 24
Third Iteration:

Calculate mid: (24 + 30) / 2 = 27
Check 27!:
27 / 5 = 5 (5 factors of 5)
27 / 25 = 1 (1 additional factor of 25)
Total trailing zeros = 6
Result: 6 >= 6, so set high = 27
Fourth Iteration:

Calculate mid: (24 + 27) / 2 = 25
Check 25!:
25 / 5 = 5 (5 factors of 5)
25 / 25 = 1 (1 additional factor of 25)
Total trailing zeros = 6
Result: 6 >= 6, so set high = 25
Fifth Iteration:

Calculate mid: (24 + 25) / 2 = 24
Check 24!:
24 / 5 = 4 (4 factors of 5)
24 / 25 = 0 (0 additional factors of 25)
Total trailing zeros = 4
Result: 4 < 6, so set low = 25
Conclusion
The binary search loop exits when low equals high, which is 25 in this case. This is the smallest number whose factorial has at least 6 trailing zeros.

Thus, the output of the code for n = 6 is 25.
